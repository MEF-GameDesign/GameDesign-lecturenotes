<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 4</span> Game Analysis Guidelines</h1>
<p>This is a list of general guidelines to analyze a videogame or a specific segment of
it. It can also be helpful to compare different games. This is not a template, but
rather a list of aspects that can be part of your analysis. Every section relates to all
the others; they are listed in an order that would facilitate building up the
argument, but can be rearranged depending on the goal of your analysis. Which
sections you should expand on depends on the focus of your discussion. Whether
you’re analyzing a whole game and its context, or your experience of playing the
game, or one specific game mechanic, are all factors that will shape your analysis.</p>
<p>A game analysis should be a critique, rather than a review. A critique breaks
down the object of study, using theoretical concepts systematically to structure
and support it. Critiques are based on argumentation and supported by evidence.
Reviews evaluate the quality of the game reviewed, and even though they also
have to be supported by argumentation, they also tend to be more subjective. The
goal of a game analysis is not to establish how good or bad a game is, but
highlight and rationalize the aspects that make the game worth studying and
contribute to understanding videogames better. Thus, you will be expected to
write a critique, which is very different from a review for a blog.</p>
<div id="before-you-start-writing-play-the-game" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Before you start writing: play the game</h2>
<ul>
<li>Play the game extensively</li>
</ul>
<p>Try to complete the game, or at least familiarize yourself with all the modes. You
should master the game as much as you can. If you’ve played it before, play it
again, to have the game fresh in your mind—replay always helps achieving new
insights about the game. The time you should be playing the game varies from
game to game. In your analysis, be explicit about how you played the game, if
there are different options (e.g. level of difficulty, character that you used.)</p>
<ul>
<li>Take notes while you play.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s good to keep track of things you come across in the game. What do you like?</p>
<p>What don’t you like? Is there something that you did not expect? Does a specific
part of the game remind you of something else (another game, or a movie, or
some other event)? Taking notes of potential examples for your paper is also a
good habit. If you can have a corresponding savegame for reference, even better.</p>
<ul>
<li>Use walkthroughs wisely.</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyone can get stuck and might need help, especially if it prevents them from
getting far enough in the game (and therefore from playing it extensively). Cheat
codes, watching walkthrough videos, or having a friend play for you are ways to
help you know more about the game, but they should not be the predominant
mode in which you experience it. If you just follow a walkthrough from the start,</p>
<p>you will be reproducing someone else’s experience of the game, not your own. It
would be like reading Cliff’s Notes instead of the actual book; in the end your
paper will show that your knowledge of the game is shallow.
Using a walkthrough can also circumvent some of the problems the game may
have, since people who write walkthroughs often instruct players how to avoid
bugs and broken design. You should also have first-hand experience of the
problems that come across while playing the game. Use walkthroughs as a way to
learn more about the game, but do not let the walkthrough dictate your
experience. If you use walkthroughs or cheats, be explicit about it, and note how
that may have changed your experience and knowledge of the game.</p>
<ul>
<li>Read what other people have written about the game
In order to know more about your game, read about it: reviews, academic articles,
press releases, newspaper articles, developer diaries, postmortems, etc. It will
help you get an idea of what other people think about the game, its production
history, and know more about the context of the game. The game box and
manuals can also be sources of relevant information; if your copy of the game
does not have its original box, some websites have repositories of them.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="types-of-analysis" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Types of Analysis</h2>
<p>Once you’ve played the game, you should decide what you want to focus on.
What makes this game worth analyzing?
What are you going to discuss?</p>
<p>The analysis is an essay, so the main argument of your analysis should be
expressed as a thesis statement. For example: “The morality system in this game
is usually hailed as unique and complex; however, I will prove that, in closer
examination, it is merely a binary system, and does not allow for complex moral
choices.” Another example: “Although Ernest Adams argues that the design of
Metal Gear Solid 2 is faulty because it breaks the”fourth wall“, my argument is
that it does not break the immersion in the game because it actually extends the
space of the game into the player’s space.”</p>
<p>You probably cannot write something very long, so choose early on what aspects
of the game you want to highlight. Rather than covering a lot of aspects, select
one or two important ones, and analyze them in depth, using other sections of the
analysis as support for your main point. Are you going to talk about the whole
game, or just a few sections? Are you going to base it on your own experience or
other people’s? Are you going to discuss other people’s takes on the game? Are
you going to discuss how the game exemplifies a particular cultural stance or
trend?
A brief summary of what the discussion is about should constitute the thesis
statement of your analysis, and it should appear in the introduction to your game.
Be clear and concise about what you will be analyzing and how.
Throughout the paper, you must apply the readings covered in class. The theory
will provide you with conceptual tools to analyze the game, by applying them, or
by proving that the game you are dealing with is an exception to them, or by
finding an area that the theory does not account for that is exemplified in your
game. Try to start with the theory and how it is relevant to the game, rather than
writing an argument and then pasting in the relevant vocabulary or references.
Different types of textual analysis will elaborate more on certain sections. Some
analyses can expand and compare more than one aspect; however, beware of
wanting to cover too much and losing focus. The following are just a few
examples of different types of textual analysis depending on their focus, but you
can come up with your own depending on what you want to highlight from the
game. Browse the analyses in the different issues of Game Studies
<a href="http://gamestudies.org/" class="uri">http://gamestudies.org/</a> to find a range of different academic analyses of games.1
- Comparative Analysis:</p>
<p>A game can be compared to other media, which entails elaborating on that
section of the analysis. This means it is a double analysis, of both the game and
the other media it is being compared to. This approach makes it necessary to
define very well what the terms of the comparison are, so you can build a strong
argument.</p>
<p>Two games can be compared to each other, which will require expanding on the
specific aspects being compared (e.g. aesthetics or different elements in the
formal analysis). Talking about two games in the same paper does not constitute
a comparative analysis: you must select the aspects that allow the comparison.</p>
<p>For example, comparing World of Warcraft with Passage is a big leap, since they
seem to have so little in common. Choose a set of aspects that allows the
comparison, either by highlighting the contrast, or by drawing similarities where
there may appear to be none.</p>
<p>For instance, A comparative analysis can deal with how different games
implement a similar fictional universe or premise (Cooking Mama vs Diner
Dash; Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic vs Star Wars: Shadows of the
Empire). It is important to be selective about the number of aspects being
compared, since it is very easy to make it into a double analysis instead of a
comparison.</p>
<ul>
<li>Reading / Interpretation</li>
</ul>
<p>This type of analysis understands what happens in the game as a representation
of something else, e.g. Tetris as a metaphor for American consumerism, as Janet
Murray argued. It can also be a symbolic reading encouraged by the game itself,</p>
<p>such as a psychological reading of Silent Hill 2 (see Rusch in Well Played 1.0).</p>
<p>Interpretations usually draw heavily on pre-existing interpretive theories and
analytical methods, from Freudian / Jungian approaches to deconstruction.</p>
<p>Interpretations are subjective, so the key to provide a convincing reading is to
ground it on evidence, and follow a systematic approach based on pre-existing
methods. You can also analyze the game from the standpoint of the theories and
methods of a field, from education to sociology or film studies. Game studies is an
interdisciplinary field, as you will see through the course. That does not mean
that other disciplines cannot analyze games and see how they relate to their
knowledge domain.</p>
<ul>
<li>Historical analysis:</li>
</ul>
<p>A historical analysis can deal, for example, with the production history of a game,</p>
<p>its reception, or how it marked a specific milestone in videogame history.</p>
<p>Historical analyses expand on the socio-historical context of the game, although depending on what historical aspect is highlighted, other sections may also have
to be strengthened. The historical innovations of a game, for example, will
probably require expanding on its formal qualities. For example, Drew Davison,
in his analysis in Well Played 1.0 accounts for his experience as a player of World
of Goo throughout his development. Given that he was part of the process, he can
provide a unique perspective in his analysis.
- Case study
The “case study” format can be used as a way to prove or disprove a set of
theoretical assumptions, by applying them in depth to a particular game. The
game becomes the reference example of a specific theory or approach. For
instance, the analysis of Ultima Underworld in Well Played 1.0 explores specific
methods to integrate gameplay and storytelling. Metal Gear Solid 2 could be
approached as a case study of using self-reference and breaking the “fourth wall”
as a way of making a commentary on the player’s behaviour.
These are just a few examples of what you may do. For the purposes of this class,
try to marry the game to the theory, and try to get an idea of what you want to say
early on.</p>
</div>
<div id="contextualize" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.3</span> Contextualize</h2>
<p>Providing a frame of reference to understand your analysis is basic to make it
accessible to your reader, particularly if they are not familiar with the game.
Games, like any other media artifacts, are not produced in a void. They are the
product of their times: the technology available at the moment, the people who
made them, or other socio-cultural trends that marked that historical moment.
Unless your analysis focuses specifically on any of these areas (e.g. a historical
analysis or a comparison with other media), this should be a brief section. Your
contextualization should include at least three of these aspects.
- Game Developer/Studio; Artists, Designers, Programmers, Writers (or whoever
is relevant).
The creative team of a game is important, particularly in the case where it
connects to other relevant games they worked on before or after this game. Some
development studios or designers have certain trademarks, or specialize on a
particular genre (e.g. Valve, Square Enix or Will Wright), so choosing one of their
games can mark a specific time in the evolution of their games, which might be
important to the context of your analysis.
- Game genre and related games
A game genre usually has a set of established conventions behind it, such as First
Person Shooters, adventure games, real-time strategy games or Role-Playing
Games. Establishing the game within a genre can help determine, for instance,
why it is like other games of the same type, or what is innovative about it. If the
game partakes of conventions from different genres, that can also be a way of
explaining what sets it apart from other games. The relations to other game
genres do not have to be exclusively digital–board and card games, as well as
other traditional games, can be the origins of certain mechanics.
The game of your choice can relate to other games by any of the elements listed
on these guidelines: developer, genre, publisher, by being released at the same
time, similar mechanics, similar themes (e.g. space flight simulators), being part
of a franchise (e.g. Star Wars or Mario), using similar controls, games that it has
influenced or that later tried to copy it, etc.
- Technological context
What platform(s) was the game developed for? It is important to note which
version of the game you are playing, e.g. Assassin’s Creed for the DS is a different
game from the PS3 version. The technology will determine, for instance, the
length of the game or whether there is an ending (think of arcade games in the
early 80s, where games typically did not end). In other cases, such as the Virtual
Boy or the Wii, the technology can also shape the way the way the game is played.
- Socio-historical context
When was the game made? It’s different to analyze a game from the 70s, when
videogames were almost exclusively played in arcades, than a recent game, now
that videogames start to enjoy a more general acceptance in cultural terms.
Where was it released? A game released in the US in the mid 80s (after the socalled videogame crash) may not have had the same influence as a game released
in Europe (where videogames were played almost exclusively in home
computers).
- Audience
Who is the game intended for? Games can create communities around them, at
times fostered by the developers themselves. The fans of a particular game can be
a phenomenon worth studying in itself, for example, as creators of content for it,
as critics/reviewers, or as assistants to other players by providing walkthroughs
or strategy guides. Studying the game community in depth can veer away from
the textual analysis provided here, so be aware that if you study the community
you may not be analyzing the game itself. It is a perfectly valid analysis, but
different from the one proposed here.
- Relations to other media
Is the game part of a franchise, a tie-in with a work in another medium (e.g. Lost
- Via Domus, Wall-E)? Is it an adaptation of the work in another medium, or is it
only using the same characters and settings? Is it inspired by a situation or
premise of another medium (e.g. Dead Rising taking the zombies-in-a-mall
premise of Dawn of the Dead)? Does it incorporate and re-work pre-existing
stories (e.g. Too Human using Norse mythology as the basis for its story, but
transposing it to a high-tech world) Does it use other works as documentation,
background or inspiration (e.g. the writings of Ann Rynd as background
reference to Bioshock)?
- If you are analyzing a game segment, how does the segment relate to the rest of
the game? What happened before and after? Are the mechanics different in this
part of the game? Does this section need a different strategy from the rest of the</p>
